## ðŸ“š Learning Path

Starting from `01.py`, the semester begins with basic Python concepts such as input/output, arithmetic operations, and variable handling.

From `21.py` onwards, we begin working with **conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `and`, `not`, `or`).

Our latest lessons have introduced **loops**, specifically the `for` loop â€” more on repetitions will be covered soon.
